Hello, my name is DaQuan Freeman.

Three words that describes me are outgoing, interesting, and unapologetic.

My favorite animals are blue whales. The fact they're the largest animal on earth yet very little is known about them astounds me. The fact that they're so large yet survive on tiny krill and crustaceans.
